Why Pytorch?
1. Pytorch helps to understand what is happenning at every single layer.
2. helps to build custom loss functions.
3. It is a perfect tool for n-dimensional data.
4. It has great debugging capacities

# nn module has all the necessary loss functions, layers, sequentiall models, activation functions etc.

# nn.functional is used for activation functions

# Torch Tensor is a placeholder for data.
# Variable is a wrapper for the tensors so that you can easily do operations between tensors and compute gradient.

#DataLoader is used to create training, testing and validating data. 
#Pytorch has a default DataLoader.
